# Biology Lab VR

Welcome to my Virtual Reality (VR) Cell Biology Laboratory. This initiative is an innovative approach aimed at providing students with a unique, interactive learning experience with various cell types. Developed exclusively for the Meta Quest 2 device, my VR lab is the outcome of a collaborative effort with the STEMed research hotbed of Los Andes University, where we continuously strive to explore new, dynamic methods of delivering STEM education.

Our goal with this project is to investigate the impact of VR technologies on the STEM learning process. Through our research, we hope to identify whether these immersive educational experiences enhance the memory retention and overall comprehension of participants. This project also includes a survey to help us identify elements that could further enrich this and future projects related to the intersection of education and mixed reality technologies. Your participation and feedback are highly valuable to us and could potentially shape the future of STEM education.
